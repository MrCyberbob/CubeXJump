# CubeXJump

A platformer, inspired by 'Geometry Dash' and 'Super Mario'.
Possibly rage-inducing.

In order to play, download the lastest release [HERE](https://github.com/MrCyberbob/CubeXJump/releases),
unpack the .zip-file, move the .exe-file into the unpacked folder (needs to be in the same folder as e.g. the "music" folder)
and run the .exe-file.
